1. Add logrus package and use for logging
2. Implement 3 REST APIs
 2.1 GET /cookie will return a Json of all cookies or an empty json if none are present
 2.2 POST /cookie Take a JSON input of an array of name value pairs and sets those cookies
 2.3 DELETE /cookie Will delete all the cookies in the request
3. Write a unit tests to make sure that 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 works correctly.
4. write a package called cookie_handler that will do the core logic for all cookie parsing.

Guidelines
1. Make sure all the error cases are handled. 
  e.g is client sends invalid json input or duplicate json input

   invalid json input
   respond with message {"error": true, "message": "invalid json"}

   For duplicate json input, there is no error, the response just sets the last value of the cookie.

Definition of Done.

1. There should be a good documentation for how someone can use these APIS
2. The test cases should run and cover all usecases
3. Code is neatly organized


//check server (download their projects)
//improve equal
//make json methods consistent
